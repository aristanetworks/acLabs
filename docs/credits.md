# Credits

- Arista cEOS-lab image is the core of every demo
- Github infrastructure for public repos. Github Actions, Packages, Pages and Codespaces - they are all amazing. One-click demo would not be possible without them.
- [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) significantly reduces complexity of deploying labs in DevOps way. Containerlab distributed under conditions of [BSD-3 license](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/blob/main/LICENSE).
- [Arista EOS downloader](https://pypi.org/project/eos-downloader/) (or sometimes it's shell alternative) - allows to uncage amazing cEOS-lab images hidden behind [arista.com](https://www.arista.com) login
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) is an amazing royalty free image library. It is not possible to provide credits to every single author, but their work is highly appreciated.

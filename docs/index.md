# Arista Community Labs

!!! Abstract "Great labs for the great community!"

    The goal of acLabs is to provide a central place to share labs build by Arista community and for Arista comminity.  
    acLabs is also used as a lab "backend" for an amazing [TecLibrary](https://tech-library.arista.com/) portal hosting a great quality documentation avalailable to all registered Arista customers.

    The core values of acLabs is simplicity and user experience. Every lab must be easy to build, maintain and use. We aim to present complex and deeply technical environments in a simple way and rely on templating, [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)(1) to deliver that.
    { .annotate }

    1. acLabs is the successor of the one-click-se-demos repository that was the first repository to use Github Codespaces for network labs.
